Task Management App

- This is a task management app which is create by using the next.js, react, and also css for styling the components.
- Here you can use the the CRUD operations with the task like you can create a task, edit a task, delete a task and toggle between the states of the task from pending to the completed. 
- When a new task is created the initial state of that task is pending and you can that state to completed when your are done with your task.
- Also for the delete and edit icons, I used react-icons library.
- And the task with the high priority have red color and it will be visible at the top of the list because it have priority order 1, same goes with the medium priority it's color is yellow having priority order 2, and the low priority color is green with priority order 3.
- When a new task is created it will be stored in the local storage until the user delete the task.

-Extract the folder, then move inside the folder in your terminal and that just write ( npm install ) command in your terminal, by doing that all required npm packages will be install. Now, write ( npm run dev ) in your command line, this will give you a IP address something like ( localhost: 3000 ), then search that IP address in your browser and then boomðŸ’¥, the will be running and after create new daily tasks for yourself ðŸ˜ƒ.
